# RAG-based Personalization and LLMs Evaluation for AI Chatbots

This thesis analyzes the evolving landscape of chatbot personalization and evaluation, focusing on the main technology: Large Language Models (LLMs). The study begins with an introductory overview of the existing fields of application of chatbots, within the realms of healthcare, education, customer support, finance, and business, and presents an overview of chatbot personalization. It delves into the Transformer architectureâ€™s core elements and examines LLM training processes, including pre-training and fine-tuning, as well as innovative prompt-based learning methods. The study highlights the enhancement of information retrieval through the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Framework and presents state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 comparing their performance, limitations and challenges.

Moreover, the study addresses the transition from rule-based to LLM-based chatbots and the critical role of system evaluation, introducing a case study on WISE, a proprietary chatbot of HPA based on LLM that leverages RAG technology to retrieve documents information. As part of my internship project, a LLM Evaluator implemented for WISE is introduced, illustrating the workflow, metrics, methodologies, and proposed future enhancements. Additionally, the thesis delves into the ethical and regulatory framework in AI. Finally, key findings are summarized and are presented suggesting directions for future research in chatbot technology.
