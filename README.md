## 📖 Abstract

This thesis explores the evolution of AI chatbots from early rule-based systems to advanced LLM-driven interfaces, highlighting their applications in education, healthcare, finance, and other domains. It examines the foundational aspects of LLMs, including their architecture, training methods, and limitations, with a focus on the Transformer architecture and the RAG paradigm. By combining retrieval mechanisms with generative models, RAG improves the relevance and personalization of chatbot responses.

The research proposes novel metrics and benchmarks for evaluating LLMs and RAG systems, supported by a case study on WISE, an AI chatbot developed by HPA. Additionally, it introduces the **LLM Evaluator**, a Python package for assessing LLM performance in chatbots, covering its methodology, implementation, and testing. Ethical considerations and regulatory frameworks are also discussed, emphasizing the importance of responsible AI development.

This work provides theoretical and practical insights into using LLMs and RAG for personalized AI chatbots, contributing to model evaluation techniques and responsible AI innovation.

## ✨ Motivation

My passion for AI chatbots comes from an interest in natural languages, artificial intelligence, and their transformative potential for human-technology interaction. This fascination is deeply rooted in my academic background in International Studies and my master’s studies in Data Science, where I developed a strong interest in machine learning and deep learning.

Key motivations:
- **Revolution in Information Access**: The release of ChatGPT in November 2022 was a pivotal moment, reshaping my view of knowledge accessibility.
- **Ethical and Technical Challenges**: Addressing concerns around bias, misinformation, hallucinations, and AI evaluation complexity.
- **Personalization and Reliability**: Investigating techniques like RAG and reliable LLM evaluation to improve AI accuracy and relevance.

This thesis aims to bridge technological advancements with ethical considerations, ensuring that AI aligns with societal values.
