\subsection{Pre-LLM Era of Chatbots}

% Finish fix citations
% merge this part w/ LLMs History in CH3
The origins of chatbots trace back to the pivotal question posed by Alan Turing in 1950: "Can machines think?" \cite{turing2009computing}. This query laid the groundwork for what is now recognized as the Turing Test, where a human participant engages in a text-based interaction with an unseen entity, attempting to discern whether they are conversing with a machine or another human. This concept catalyzed the early development of chatbots, which, while rudimentary by contemporary standards, marked significant strides in artificial intelligence during their time.

\subsubsection{1960–1980: Foundational Developments}

Between 1960 and 1980, the first wave of chatbots emerged, setting the stage for future advancements. One of the earliest examples is ELIZA, developed in 1966 at MIT. ELIZA was designed to simulate a Rogerian psychotherapist by identifying keywords and applying pattern matching techniques, although it lacked genuine comprehension of the inputs \cite{weizenbaum1966eliza}. Despite its limitations, ELIZA garnered significant attention for its ability to mimic human-like interactions, even forming emotional connections with users, which later sparked ethical debates \cite{zimmerman2023human}. Another notable chatbot from this era is PARRY, introduced in 1972 to emulate a person with paranoid schizophrenia. PARRY advanced chatbot technology by exhibiting more structured and emotionally responsive behavior, even engaging in conversations with ELIZA \cite{colby1971artificial}.

\subsubsection{1981–2009: Technological Advancements and Mainstream Adoption}

The period from 1981 to 2009 witnessed substantial progress in chatbot technology, characterized by the emergence of more sophisticated systems. In 1984, the AI program Racter was introduced, known for producing English prose and mimicking conversational behavior \cite{wikipedia2023racter}. 

Around the same time, the Jabberwacky project, initiated in 1988, aimed to simulate casual human conversation in a friendly manner. Jabberwacky evolved by interacting with humans, storing key phrases from dialogues to enhance its knowledge base, and employing a context-aware algorithm to generate relevant responses \cite{shawar2007fostering}. The 1990s brought further innovations, such as Creative Labs' Dr. Sbaitso, a chatbot designed for MS-DOS systems that utilized early text-to-speech technology \cite{deryugina2010chatterbots}. In 1995, Dr. Richard S. Wallace introduced A.L.I.C.E. (Artificial Language Internet Computer Entity), which leveraged a significantly expanded knowledge base and employed Artificial Intelligence Markup Language (AIML) to define conversational guidelines \cite{wallace2009anatomy}. Despite receiving acclaim and winning the Loebner Prize three times in the 2000s, A.L.I.C.E. still fell short of passing the Turing Test \cite{shum2018eliza}. The evolution continued with the launch of SmarterChild on the AIM platform in 2001, offering users interactive communication for tasks like weather updates and stock prices \cite{adamopoulou2020chatbots}. In 2008, Cleverbot, a successor to Jabberwacky, was introduced, demonstrating a unique learning strategy based on human interactions, achieving a 59.3\% human-like rating in a formal Turing Test \cite{wikipedia2023cleverbot}.

\subsubsection{2010–2016: Emergence of Intelligent Voice Assistants}

\section{Personalization in LLM-Based Chatbots}

The domain of chatbot personalization has evolved significantly, with earlier approaches laying the groundwork for the sophisticated systems we see today. Initial contributions by researchers focused on developing chatbots that could adapt to user inputs and retain user-specific information, such as personal preferences and evolving interests. These early systems primarily utilized dialogue management techniques like Example-Based Dialogue Management (EBDM), which relied on a repository of dialogue examples. Each example in the database contained a specific user input paired with an appropriate system response, enabling the chatbot to deliver more personalized interactions compared to traditional rule-based systems \cite{kim2015acquisition, bang2015example}.

However, while EBDM-based systems marked a significant improvement in personalization, they were inherently limited by the scope and diversity of examples within their databases. The extent of personalization was often constrained to the information explicitly provided by users during interactions, making it difficult to account for more nuanced or dynamic user preferences. Additionally, these systems were dependent on a pre-existing set of examples, limiting their ability to handle novel or unexpected inputs.

In an effort to address these limitations, subsequent research explored machine learning-based approaches to chatbot personalization. For instance, Shumanov et al. demonstrated the use of machine learning to predict user personality traits, categorizing users as either "introverted" or "extraverted". The chatbot's responses were then tailored accordingly, with introverted users receiving more goal-oriented and efficient communication, while extraverted users experienced more assertive and engaging interactions. Although this approach represented a more sophisticated method of personalization, it still faced challenges related to the complexity and variability of human communication \cite{shumanov2021making}.

The advent of LLMs offers a transformative opportunity to overcome these limitations and advance the field of chatbot personalization. LLMs have the capability to combine training on vast amounts of user data with state-of-the-art natural language generation (NLG), allowing for a level of personalization that is both more nuanced and scalable. Unlike previous methods, LLM-based chatbots do not require extensive human involvement, hand-written rules, or a limited set of pre-programmed examples. Instead, they can dynamically generate personalized responses based on the context of the conversation and the specific needs of the user, providing a more seamless and intuitive user experience.

Despite the promise of LLMs in enhancing chatbot personalization, there remains a notable gap in the practical implementation and testing of these systems. While recent studies acknowledge the potential of integrating Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) into chatbot systems to enhance both automation and personalization, empirical research that rigorously assesses the effectiveness of these techniques is still limited. Furthermore, there is a lack of established benchmarks specifically designed to evaluate the impact of personalization in LLM-based chatbots, which hinders the ability to systematically measure and compare the performance of these systems \cite{verma2023generative}.

As the field continues to evolve, it is crucial to develop and refine methods for assessing the quality of personalized interactions in LLM-based chatbots. This includes not only technical metrics related to natural language processing (NLP) but also measures that capture the overall user experience, such as the relevance, coherence, and satisfaction of the generated responses. Addressing these research gaps will be essential for advancing the development of personalized chatbots and ensuring their effectiveness across a wide range of applications.
