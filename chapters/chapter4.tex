\subsection{Introducing WISE: Transforming Document Management}

For decades, the process of searching and consulting documents and manuals in companies has followed the same paradigm. This traditional method involves identifying keywords, clicking on each link, opening documents, and finally selecting and gathering the information of interest. This workflow is not only long and repetitive but also highly inefficient, consuming valuable time and resources.

WISE revolutionizes document management by leveraging Generative AI. Through the use of large language models (LLMs) integrated within a proprietary workflow, WISE enables users to perform complex natural language searches across multiple sources and entire databases. 

When a question is posed, WISE efficiently queries the relevant documents and data, extracts the pertinent information, and provides a response within seconds. The answers are delivered in a text and conversational format, mimicking the interaction one would have with an expert colleague. WISE stands out as a Virtual Assistant that is always available, secure, reliable, and knowledgeable, significantly simplifying and accelerating the document management process. \cite{hpa2024}

\end{figure}

\subsection{WISE Functionality and Data Access}

WISE operates through a series of systematic steps that ensure efficient and accurate information retrieval. The following steps outline the core functionality of WISE:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The company uploads documents that form the knowledge base (manuals, regulations, circulars, etc.) into WISE.
    \item The user asks a question in natural language as if conversing with a colleague.
    \item WISE provides the best possible answer within seconds, citing available sources. If the user requests more details, WISE remembers the conversation and contextualizes the new request.
    \item WISE can be easily integrated into the company website and can connect to databases and enterprise systems (ERP, CRM) via APIs and custom connectors.
\end{enumerate}

By handling foreign language conversations transparently, WISE facilitates seamless communication and data retrieval across multinational corporations.
    
    \item \textbf{Supports structured and unstructured databases:} WISE can handle various types of data formats, providing flexibility and comprehensive search capabilities. Whether the data is organized in structured formats such as SQL databases or in unstructured forms like text documents and emails, WISE can efficiently process and retrieve relevant information. This versatility makes it an indispensable tool for organizations with diverse data storage systems.
    
    \item \textbf{Two-factor authentication (2FA) or corporate single sign-on (SSO):} Ensures secure access to the system. Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide two forms of identification before accessing the system. Corporate single sign-on allows employees to log in with their existing corporate credentials, simplifying the authentication process while maintaining high security standards.
    
    \item \textbf{Multimodality:} Supports images and videos, allowing users to query multimedia content and enhancing the scope of information retrieval. This feature enables WISE to process and understand visual data, making it possible to search and retrieve information from images, diagrams, and video content. It is particularly useful in industries such as manufacturing and security, where visual data is critical.
    
    \item \textbf{Response rating and RLHF:} Users can rate the responses provided by WISE, facilitating continuous improvement through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). This feedback mechanism helps in refining the AI models and improving the accuracy and relevance of the information provided. It ensures that WISE evolves based on user interactions and feedback, leading to enhanced performance over time.
    
    \item \textbf{Support for spreadsheets (XLS):} WISE can interpret and retrieve information from spreadsheet files. This capability is crucial for organizations that rely on spreadsheets for data management and reporting. WISE can read, process, and extract relevant information from complex Excel files, providing users with quick and accurate data access.
    
    \item \textbf{Automatic summaries, comparison, and inconsistency checks between documents:} WISE can generate concise summaries, compare documents, and identify inconsistencies. This feature saves users significant time by automatically creating summaries of long documents, highlighting key points, and identifying discrepancies between different documents. It enhances the user's ability to quickly understand and utilize the information.
    
    \item \textbf{Automatic text generation (manuals, contracts, articles) from databases:} WISE can create various textual documents based on the data it accesses. This includes generating user manuals, contracts, articles, and other documentation, ensuring that all generated content is consistent with the latest data and company standards. It streamlines the documentation process, reducing the workload on human employees.
    
    \item \textbf{Uses triggers and actions for process automation:} Enhances workflow automation by responding to specific triggers with predefined actions. For example, WISE can automatically send notifications, update records, or initiate workflows based on user queries or changes in the data. This automation capability improves operational efficiency and reduces the potential for human error.
    
    \item \textbf{Integration with enterprise systems (CRM, ERP):} WISE seamlessly integrates with other enterprise systems, enhancing its utility and reach. By connecting with Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, WISE can access and leverage data across various business functions. This integration ensures that users have a comprehensive view of the organization's data and processes, facilitating informed decision-making.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Advanced User Interface}

WISE offers multiple interaction modes to cater to various user preferences and needs:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Classic conversational interface (chat):} Allows users to interact with WISE through a text-based chat interface.
    \item \textbf{Voice interface (speech-to-text):} Enables users to communicate with WISE using their voice, which is converted to text for processing.
    \item \textbf{Avatar (text-to-speech):} Provides an engaging and interactive experience by converting text responses into speech, represented by an avatar.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Advantages of WISE}

WISE offers several key advantages that make it an invaluable tool for businesses. These benefits ensure that WISE not only meets the immediate needs of an organization but also provides long-term value through continuous improvement and adaptability:
